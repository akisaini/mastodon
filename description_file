After a long national discussion on sending heavy weapons to Ukraine, German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht announced that Germany would send 7 PzH 2000 howitzers to counter Russian troops.

“With this we are adding to the five Dutch self-propelled howitzers to reach a total of twelve,” Lambrecht’s ministry said in a tweet, adding that “howitzer training in Germany has been prepared and will begin next week.”

She told a press conference in Sliac, Slovakia, that the 7 PzH 2000 would come from the German Army's pool of weapons, which are in maintenance, so their transfer to Ukraine would not adversely affect the German Army.
The announcement came a week after the German parliament voted to send “heavy weapons” to Ukraine following weeks of intense debate in Germany on whether that would be a step too far.

In this video Defense Updates analyzes how German origin PzH 2000 howitzers could wreak havoc on Russian Forces? Ukraine ?

Sky's Alex Crawford reports from Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, the one remaining pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the war-zone which is Luhansk.

There are estimated to be a few thousand civilians left in the city - many of whom have stayed to care for elderly relatives - and they are living without electricity, running water, phone or internet connection, and under the constant threat of Russian shelling.

Twelve people have been killed and dozens injured in heavy Russian shell attacks in eastern Ukraine, as Nato's secretary general said Moscow's offensive in the Donbas appeared to have stalled. 

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) 

However, he warned that this didn’t mean Russia had abandoned its strategic goals, adding “we should be prepared for a protracted war”.

Ukraine's forces have also managed to push back the Russians in the area around Kharkiv. Today military chiefs said a total of 23 settlements had now been liberated - mainly in that region. 

Warning: There are distressing images in this report.
